It's a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) `tile` card! With a ring!

A card based on the fabulous inbuilt [`tile` card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/tile/) to visualise your sensor data. Use `ring-tile` cards to bring your sensor `tile` cards to life. Gain insights from your home's data at a glance.

You can make the ring the star of the show for new, bigger tiles. Here's a cluster of weather sensors.

Or a cluster of sensors to monitor a server.

Or you can go *really* big to make whole new dashboards - good for wall displays. `ring-tile` looks great in dark mode too!

## Using ring-tile card

`ring-tile` card has been designed for ease of use: it requires minimal configuration to get a great looking result. You can use it as a drop-in replacement for the inbuilt `tile` card (**Note!** at the moment, `ring-tile` card only works properly with `sensor` entities. Not all native `tile` card options are supported).
